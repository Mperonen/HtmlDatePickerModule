# HtmlDatePickerModule
A simple custom built date and time picker module. Uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. This contains front-end only.

Goal is to have a HTML, CSS and Javascript structure which is easy to implement.

Features:
- Date picker
- Time picker (WIP). Time will have day hour timeline view which can display available times within the day.
- Multi-language support. Some texts and labels will change according to the language set in html tag's "lang" attribute. Currently supported languages are FI and EN.
